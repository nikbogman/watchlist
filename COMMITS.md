# Commit messages

This repo follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

<body>

<footer>
```

Only the first line is required.

## Type

| Type | Use for |
|---|---|
| `feat` | A new user-facing capability |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither adds a feature nor fixes a bug |
| `test` | Adding or changing tests only |
| `docs` | Documentation only (PRDs, CONTEXT.md, READMEs) |
| `chore` | Dependencies, config, tooling, scaffolding |
| `perf` | A performance improvement |
| `style` | Formatting only, with no behaviour change |

## Scope

The part of the workspace the commit touches:

| Scope | Covers |
|---|---|
| `mobile` | `apps/mobile` |
| `server` | `apps/server` |
| `repo` | Root config, workspace setup, and agent tooling (`.claude/`, `.mcp.json`) |

Leave out the scope if a commit spans both apps. Split the commit instead when the changes are unrelated.

## Summary

- Imperative mood: "add", not "added" or "adds".
- Lowercase, and no full stop at the end.
- 72 characters or fewer for the whole first line.
- Use the domain terms from [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md): *To watch*, *Watched*, *Favourite*, *Tracked movie*.

## Body

Optional. Explain **why** the change was made, not what changed (the diff shows that). Wrap lines at 72 characters and leave a blank line after the summary.

## Footer

- `BREAKING CHANGE: <what breaks and how to migrate>` for breaking changes. Also add `!` after the type or scope: `feat(server)!: ...`.
- `Refs: docs/prd/01-movie-lists.md` to link the PRD the change implements.
- `Co-Authored-By:` lines for co-authors, including AI agents.

## Examples

```
feat(server): add endpoint to mark a movie as watched
```

```
fix(mobile): keep favourite button disabled while request is pending
```

```
chore(repo): add agent-device and Better Auth agent skills
```

```
feat(server)!: require a session on all movie routes

Search and movie details were reachable without login, which let
anyone use the TMDB quota through the server.

BREAKING CHANGE: clients must send a valid session with every
request except Better Auth's own endpoints.
Refs: docs/prd/01-movie-lists.md
```

## One commit, one change

Each commit should build and pass typechecks on its own. Keep refactors separate from feature work.
